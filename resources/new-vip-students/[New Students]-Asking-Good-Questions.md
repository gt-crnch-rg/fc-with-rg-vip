These two resources help address a common problem we see with researchers in a new and developing field. How do you ask questions if you don't know what's going on? 

## TLDR Version
* Be polite and respectful of other's time in email or online in forums.
* Do your relevant web searches and background reading first. If there's a manual, check it out!
* Try to include as much detail about your problem as possible in your question. However, for code, please create a [minimal reproducible example (MRE)](https://github.gatech.edu/crnch-rg/vip-rg/wiki/%5BDevelopment%5D-Minimal-Reproducible-Examples).

## Asking Questions When Using CRNCH Resources

This advice on submitting tickets for hardware issues is shared from our [CRNCH RG ReadTheDocs](https://gt-crnch-rg.readthedocs.io/en/main/general/mailing-list-help-tickets.html). Please check out this link for more information on the resources available for Rogues Gallery hardware.

Asking your question in a clear and meaningful way is the easiest way to get assistance. We generally recommend the following for asking a clear suggestion:

1. Share the machine name you are having issues with: Ex: “Python notebooks don’t run on rg-neuro-dev.crnch.gatech.edu”
2. If possible, share the output using quotes or an attached log file. **Please share output as text where possible instead of a screenshot!**. If we are trying to recreate a problem you have it is much easier to copy and paste text than decipher it from a screenshot.
3. Create a “minimum working/reproducible example” (MWE/MRE). In many cases, sharing a huge log file for a full application is not useful to you or to the maintainers of a particular system. See this page on creating an effective MWE: [MWE overview](https://github.com/gt-crnch-rg/fc-with-rg-vip/blob/main/docs/[Development]-Minimal-Reproducible-Examples.md)
4. Don’t just state “Feature X doesn’t work!”. We’ll ask you more follow-up questions so it’s best to share more detail initially to get your question answered in a prompt fashion.
