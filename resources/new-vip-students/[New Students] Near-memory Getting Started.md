## Near-Memory Getting Started Resources

This subteam is focused on near-memory computation and acceleration. A traditional computer system will use "caches" as part of their memory system to keep track of often-used data. A good example is if you are updating an array or matrix that contains elements of an image - you will likely iterate of each row and column of the image in order and you may reuse some rows/columns as you compute on the input image. This type of data can easily be cached and reused to speed up processing. "Near-memory computing" tries to move computation closer to the data it uses to avoid some of the effects of building large caches.

**Why do we need to avoid big caches?** Some data sets are "sparse" - that is, they have a large number of non-valid elements, like zeroes. Accesses to a sparse data structure cannot be easily cached or predicted because most of the data is not useful, and the data structure itself might be much bigger than a "dense" matrix. A good example of this is data that can be [easily represented as a graph](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-a-graph-data-structure). As an example, Facebook uses graphs to represent how you and your friends are connected. While a graph data structure can be converted to other formats like a matrix, it is often difficult to process large graphs with today's systems.
