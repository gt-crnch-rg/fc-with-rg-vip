## Opportunities for Undergraduate Research at Georgia Tech
Georgia Tech has several nice options for undergraduate research that you can and should take advantage of:
* [Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP)](http://urop.gatech.edu/) - The  provides a general support organization for research as well as numbers events 
* [Undergraduate Research Opportunities in Computing (UROC)](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/content/undergraduate-research-opportunities-computing-uroc)
* [Vertically Integrated Projects (VIP)](vip.gatech.edu) - team-based research projects with faculty advisors for 1-3 credit hours. These projects are persistent from semester to semester and are often used to fulfill student's senior design credits. 



## How do I get funded to do research?

* [President's Undergraduate Research Awards (PURA)](http://www.undergradresearch.gatech.edu/content/presidents-undergraduate-research-awards)
* Summer research programs or GTRI internships - UROP research ambassadors have a nice summer research information session [each semester](http://www.undergradresearch.gatech.edu/undergraduate-research-ambassador-events).
* Professors often have funded research they will advertise via UROP, UROC, or their website. In many cases they will require you to either 1) take 1 semester of research for credit or 2) take their class and do well in it.
