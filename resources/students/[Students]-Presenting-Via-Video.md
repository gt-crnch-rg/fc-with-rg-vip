# Presenting via Video

This page is mostly TBD but will collect some hints on presenting in a digital format (as is more common these days).



## Presentation tips

Make your slides visual! "What can I change for each sentence?"

* Each sentence should have a bullet point or a highlight for a graph to make the slide "move".
* This increases engagement. This helps edit down sentences as well.
