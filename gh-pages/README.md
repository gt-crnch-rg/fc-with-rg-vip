## What Should you Learn from the RG VIP?

We hope that you will learn about an interesting research area from  your chosen subteam, whether it is neuromorphic, reconfigurable,  near-memory, quantum computing, or something else. However, we also want to emphasize that all students should work to learn certain key "soft"  skills that are useful in both research and industry settings. In many  cases, you will be working on a remote platform with a collaborative  software infrastructure. With that in mind, we hope that you will learn  at least the basics from the topics below.

### Key VIP Soft Skills

- Development
  - Using remote servers with SSH, X forwarding, and VNC
  - Understanding how "[paths](docs/[Linux] Understanding PATHs)" and other basic commands work in Linux.
  - Debugging and writing minimum reproducible examples to ask for assistance in debugging
  - Documenting code so that others can understand it later
- Collaboration
  - Using a collaborative software tool like git, including git branches and forks
  - Basic project management
  - Using git issues to track problems in a collaborative way
- Presentation and communication skills
  - Writing good notebook pages and breaking down large projects into smaller next steps
  - Presenting your work via slides and posters
- Research
  - Reading and understanding research papers
  - [Framing your research in terms of impact (Heilmeier Catechism)](https://github.gatech.edu/crnch-rg/vip-rg/wiki/[Students]-Framing-Your-Research)
  - Being resilient when research doesn't go as expected (or often when it goes slower than expected).
