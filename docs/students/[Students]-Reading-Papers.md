# Reading Papers

There are many good guides that present ideas on how to get the most out of research papers, so it's good to read through a few of these especially as you get started with a new area. Kyle Shannon's guide below is especially useful as it lists the following key steps:

1) Read the abstract - ask yourself a few questions to understand "why" the authors wrote this paper. 
2) Spend about 15 minutes skimming the paper - focus on the introduction, results, and conclusions.
3) Review the figures in the paper - what is each of these telling you as a reader? 
4) Go back and more critically read the paper focusing on key questions. These might include:
    * "What is new in this paper?" (novelty)
    * "What is the key problem being solved?"
    * "How does this paper propose to solve the problem?"

A succinct way of thinking about these questions is summarized by the [Heilmeier Catechism](https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/heilmeier-catechism), which proposes 8 questions about research in general. Many of these questions also apply to a critical reading of a research paper.
