One of the key skills for students to learn is how to ask for help in debugging code they write. It's easy to post and say "My code doesn't work and here's a screenshot with the error", but that is unlikely to elicit good responses from your team members, TAs, or professors. What is important is to learn how to create a _minimal reproducible example_ (called an MRE here). These are self-contained pieces of code that show how to reproduce the error in a way that someone else can run it and follow your code and thought process. 

## How do I create a minimal reproducible example?
StackOverflow, a community site for asking for help with code debugging has some very nice guidelines for creating a [minimum reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). This page links to another [blog](https://ericlippert.com/2014/03/05/how-to-debug-small-programs/) by Eric Lippert that talks about debugging small programs to better create a minimum working example. Both of these sites have good resources on how to [ask for assistance with code debugging](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) and tips for creating a small, reproducible example code. Please read through these blogs and take their advice into consideration when creating your own MRE.

## Takeaways (TLDR)

To reiterate, the StackOverflow advice states that your code example with the error in question should be:
* Minimal – Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem
* Complete – Provide all parts someone else needs to reproduce your problem in the question itself
* Reproducible – Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem

Following these steps will help save you and your peers time in debugging and it also helps you to think about the problem you have encountered. In some cases, writing up a MRE can actually help solve a particular challenging bug because it forces you to think about your problem in a different framing.
