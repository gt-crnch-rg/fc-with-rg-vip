# Git Projects and Issues

New project management tools from Github can allow your group to organize tasks and assign small tasks to group members to contribute to a larger goal for each semester. Note that we do not require you to use Github projects, but we do suggest that your team utilize Kanban-style organization tools like [Asana](https://asana.com/), [Microsoft Planner (included in Teams)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/planner), [Trello](https://trello.com), or [Github Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) where possible. 

Similarly, we don't require that students fully utilize "waterfall" or "Agile" development workflows, but we do encourage students to utilize some of the principles from these workflows to help break larger projects down into smaller tasks. With Github, we recommend that you consider breaking tasks into ["Issues"](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) which can then be tied to documentation or code commits.
