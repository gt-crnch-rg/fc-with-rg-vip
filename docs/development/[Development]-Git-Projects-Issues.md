# Git Projects and Issues

New project management tools from Github can allow your group to organize tasks and assign small tasks to group members to contribute to a larger goal for each semester. Note that we do not require you to use Github projects, but we do suggest that your team utilize Kanban-style organization tools like [Asana](https://asana.com/), [Microsoft Planner (included in Teams)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/planner), [Trello](https://trello.com), or [Github Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) where possible. 

Similarly, we don't require that students fully utilize "waterfall" or "Agile" development workflows, but we do encourage students to utilize some of the principles from these workflows to help break larger projects down into smaller tasks. With Github, we recommend that you consider breaking tasks into ["Issues"](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) which can then be tied to documentation or code commits. 

For a good overview of Github projects and issues this video provides a good breakdown and demonstration.

We also recommend that you try to break your issues down into small, actionable tasks. One way to do this is presented in this video and related documentation by using task lists.

## Example for the VIP class

We have created a project that is meant to help new students understand what they should be working on each week. This is not a comprehensive list, but you'll notice that it mixes notes and issues in a Kanban style board. In future semesters, we'll work to demonstrate how this works for new students.

We also have created an issue that demonstrates how to use task lists. Notice that this can be a powerful way to breakdown larger issues into smaller tasks.

## Agile Resources
Use these resources as a reference! Agile development focuses on small sprints with iterative development and testing, so it can be a good fit for many VIP subteams.
