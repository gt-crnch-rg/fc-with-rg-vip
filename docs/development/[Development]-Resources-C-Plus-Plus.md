# Resources for Learning C++

**NOTE:** Many of the books listed here can be found for free via the Georgia Tech library or via GT's subscription to OReilley Books. It might be a good idea to buy one or two books you find to be good resources, but you can study many of these books for free!

## Georgia Tech Courses that Teach C++
* [ECE 2036](https://hamblen.ece.gatech.edu/2036/) - Engineering Software Design (formerly known as [ECE 3090](http://griley.ece.gatech.edu/riley/ece3090/))
* [CS 1372] - Structured Program Design for Engineers; C++ course for non-CS majors
* [CS 2345] - Advanced Practical Object-Oriented Programming; templates, generic programming, and smart pointers

## C-related Books and Resources
While this page mostly focuses on C++ resources (since C++ is a superset of C), there are several good C books you can refer to. 

* [The C Programming Language, 2nd edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-c-programming/9780133086249/), by Kernighan and Richie (sometimes referred to as "K&R") 
* [C Programming Absolute Beginner's Guide,  3rd Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/c-programming-absolute/9780133149869/),  by Greg Perry
* [Learn C The Hard Way](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learn-c-the/9780133124385/), by Zed Shaw

## C++ Resources (Books)

Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++ has written some nice books on C++, including his books [The C++ Programming Language](http://www.stroustrup.com/4th.html) and the longer [Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++](). 

[A Tour of C++](http://www.stroustrup.com/Tour.html)  focuses on newer C++ features found in C++11 and C++14 including the usage of new STL containers, templates, and features like lambdas. This book is relatively cheap to purchase and is also available [in part online](https://isocpp.org/tour) and in full from the [GT library](https://gatech-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=TN_safari_s9780134998053&context=PC&vid=01GALI_GIT&search_scope=primo_central&tab=default_tab&lang=en_US).

More advanced books include the following:
* [Effective Modern C++](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033707.do) - Provides examples of advanced feature usage in modern C++
* [C++ Templates - The Complete Guide, 2nd edition](http://www.tmplbook.com/) - Covers C++17 features and template usage
* [Large-Scale C++ Software Design](https://www.informit.com/store/large-scale-c-plus-plus-software-design-9780201633627) - This book is a bit older (late 90s) but covers design usage for large software projects.

Other C++ books include:
* [Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++, Second Edition](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-principles-and/9780133796759/)
* [A Tour of C++ - discusses Modern C++ Features](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/a-tour-of/9780134998053/)
* [Scott Myer's Lists of the Most Important C++ Books](https://www.artima.com/articles/the-most-important-c-booksemeverem)
* [Jason Turner's C++ Best Practices](https://leanpub.com/cppbestpractices)
* [Functional Programming in C++](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-plus-plus) - recommended by Alex Huebel for functional programming concepts

## Online courses for C++ Training (edX, Coursera)

Many thanks to David Joyner for sharing some of these resources. 

* [Microsoft's Introduction to C++](https://www.classcentral.com/course/edx-introduction-to-c-4758)
* [C++ for C Programmers](https://www.coursera.org/learn/c-plus-plus-a)
* [Microsoft's Advanced C++ Course (EdX)](https://www.edx.org/course/advanced-c) - there is also an introductory and intermediate version of this EdX course.

### Other Online Resources
* [Cppreference.com](http://cppreference.com/) - The up-to-date, authorative reference for all features in C++. Updated by C++ standards committee members.
* [Geeksforgeeks C++ Pages](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-plus-plus/)
* [C++ subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cplusplus/)

## Resources for Beginners - YouTube Videos

Jason Turner is a professional C++ trainer and podcaster, and he was kind enough to share the following resources to build a good foundation in C++. He recommends following these videos up with the "Tour of C++" book to solidify an intermediate knowledge of newer C++ features.

Jason's videos on what make C++ unique. 
* [The Best Parts of C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iz5Qx18H6lg)
* [The Important Parts of C++98](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78Y_LRZPVRg)
* [The Important Parts of C++11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5n6xMUKU3A)
* [The Important Parts of C++14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXxNvaEdNHI)
* [The Important Parts of C++17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpFjOlzg1r4)

He also recommends videos from Kate Gregory. Examples include:  
* [It's Complicated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTexD26jIN4)
* [Simplicity: Not Just For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0Ak6xtVXno)

## Resources for Intermediate Learners

Graham Lopez is an NVIDIA C++ developer and contributor to the Kokkos project and numerous Department of Energy C++ projects including QMCPack.

He recommends:
* Watching videos on YouTube from CppCon, C++Now, and MeetingC++. Each year these conferences include over a hundred talks on topics ranging from the basic to the advanced. 
    * [CppCon YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/user/CppCon)
    * [C++Now YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/user/BoostCon/featured)
    * [MeetingCpp YouTube page](https://www.youtube.com/user/MeetingCPP)
* Watching videos from some of the better full-time trainers for C++. Each link has an example talk but you can search for each person's name in YouTube and online.
